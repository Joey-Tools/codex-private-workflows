# Diagnostic Completion Controller

## Summary

- Reject verifier filename lookalikes by accepting only the exact canonical path or GitHub PR merge-ref path (`@refs/pull/<number>/merge`).
- Preserve known-PR concurrency grouping; use run IDs only to isolate association-less runs, never as the action `pr_number`.

## Current State

- Before runner allocation, the controller admits only completed pull-request runs of the canonical verifier workflow, using its exact path or the GitHub PR merge-ref path `@refs/pull/<number>/merge`; workflow filename lookalikes are rejected. Zero or one associated pull request is accepted; multiple associations are rejected. An empty association passes the `0` sentinel to the runtime's separately verified fallback.
- Concurrency stays keyed by the associated PR, issue, or dispatch number first; workflow-run IDs are isolation fallbacks only when those keys are absent and never become the action's `pr_number`.
- Only CODEX_REVIEW_GATE_AUTO_REQUEST=true, attempt 1, failure, and one associated pull request select begin-review and an automatic review request. Other eligible completions select report-completion, including successful runs, reruns, and runs when automatic requests are disabled.
- report-completion updates diagnostic state only; it does not rerun or dispatch workflows, request a review, scan provider findings, or write the required check. The canonical verifier check remains the merge authority.
- Event subscriptions, permissions, runner selection, verifier workflow, CODEOWNERS, GitHub variables, and rulesets are unchanged. This implementation does not provide live settings or canary evidence.

## Next Steps

- No controller implementation follow-up is required. Any live canary or operational state must be established from separate evidence.
