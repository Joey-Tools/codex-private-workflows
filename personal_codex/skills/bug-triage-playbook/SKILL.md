description: Transport and inspect allowlisted Cisco Jenkins HTTPS console, API, and ZIP artifacts with bounded authentication, redirects, output, extraction, and wall time. Use when Joey has an exact remote artifact URL or a local ZIP and needs a private fixed-profile probe, fetch, member listing, text view, or single-member extraction before diagnosis.

# Bounded Artifact Transport

## Scope

This private skill supplies one canonical artifact transport helper for Joey's fixed Cisco Jenkins policy. It does not define a generic root-cause method, GitHub Actions triage, tracker lookup, or remote process diagnosis. Use the relevant forge skill or [$cisco-trackers-lookup](../cisco-trackers-lookup/SKILL.md) for those tasks, and use ordinary evidence-based reasoning after the requested artifact is available.

The helper is `scripts/jenkins_artifact_probe.py`. Its private configuration is fixed and fail-closed by this release process; callers cannot widen hosts, auth profiles, deadlines, or resource ceilings at runtime.

## Workflow

1. Identify the exact URL or local ZIP and the smallest required operation.
2. For a remote artifact, check the named auth profile's documented environment variables without printing their values.
3. Use `probe-url` for access metadata, `show-url` for bounded text, or `fetch-url` for a new persistent file.
4. Use `zip-list` to validate and orient an archive, `zip-show` for bounded member text, or `zip-extract` to publish one exact member.
5. Report the sanitized URL label or local path, selected member, decisive bounded evidence, and any explicit auth, policy, deadline, or limit blocker.

See `references/jenkins-artifact-recipes.md` for command forms and the hard-safety contract.

## Safety Contract

- Remote URLs must use an allowlisted HTTPS host. Inline credentials and URL fragments are rejected.
- URL text must be printable ASCII. Percent-encode spaces, Unicode path/query data, and other non-ASCII bytes before invoking the helper.
- Every redirect is revalidated before the next request. Authenticated redirects may remain only on the same effective HTTPS origin, including port, and redirect hops are capped.
- One parent process enforces a monotonic wall deadline over the complete worker operation. Socket timeout is a secondary bound, not the deadline.
- Network, text, lines, emitted output, ZIP local/central metadata, compression, decompression, and selected members all have hard ceilings. CLI flags can only lower them. Successful stdout is emitted as budgeted UTF-8, with non-printable characters escaped; probe metadata must be bounded printable single-line ASCII.
- Streaming reads request at most the remaining budget plus one byte; no artifact command performs an unbounded `read()`.
- ZIP source acquisition streams into a capped private snapshot, and ZIP inventory validation runs through a size-bounded seek/read view before allocating members. Selected local/central metadata—flags, methods, names, CRC and sizes, data descriptors, disk numbers, and 32-bit format bounds—is cross-checked; ZIP64 is rejected. It allows only stored or bounded-output DEFLATE members and rejects absolute or traversing paths, portable duplicate or non-printable names, symlinks, special files, encryption, excessive size/count/ratio, and truncated metadata. Before display or publication, `zip-show` and `zip-extract` independently stream the exact declared compressed span, require its output length and CRC to match, and require DEFLATE to reach its one exact end without unused or unconsumed trailing data. `zip-list` validates metadata only and does not claim payload integrity. The helper never calls `extractall`.
- `fetch-url` and `zip-extract` require an existing safe parent chain and an absent destination under the current workspace or `/tmp`. They stream to a same-parent mode-`0600` temporary regular file, verify expected length, and publish with an atomic no-clobber link. Non-sticky group/other-writable path components are rejected.
- Parent directory child churn is benign. Parent replacement or access-policy change, destination appearance, temporary-entry replacement, content-limit failure, or failed revalidation prevents publication.
- Root and processes running as the helper's effective UID are trusted principals. Cleanup does not promise conditional-unlink safety against either.
- Output access checks cover traditional owner/mode/sticky semantics, not extended ACLs. Do not use a parent chain whose ACL grants another principal read, add, delete, or write access.

## Boundaries

- Do not replace the helper with raw authenticated `curl` merely for convenience. If a required HTTP feature is unsupported, stop and state the missing feature.
- Do not create output parents automatically and do not choose an existing output path.
- Do not pass secrets in URLs, arbitrary header flags, or arbitrary environment-variable names.
- Status output strips URL userinfo, queries, and fragments. Treat that output as a safe label, not a byte-for-byte artifact identifier.
- Do not treat a transport failure as artifact evidence. Distinguish policy rejection, missing auth, remote HTTP failure, deadline, resource limit, malformed archive, and successful inspection.
- The acquired private ZIP snapshot is stable and always treated as untrusted. Source size and modification time detect ordinary concurrent changes but cannot prove stability against a writer that mutates content and restores those metadata signals.
- The parent normalizes inherited `SIGCHLD` handling until exact `waitpid` reap and defers blockable signals across the fork handoff and each ownership transition, so Python-level parent interruption cannot skip child reap or signal a PID after the worker was reaped. Receipt cleanup is attempted after enforced deadlines, worker failures, and Python-level parent interruption; it reports `inconclusive` when no exact receipt is available. Abrupt parent termination that cannot execute cleanup, including unhandled `SIGTERM` or `SIGHUP`, `SIGKILL`, and power loss, is outside the guarantee and can leave a private temporary file or a fully published final file.
- Do not leave fetched or extracted artifacts silently. Remove task-scoped artifacts when safe or report retained paths.
