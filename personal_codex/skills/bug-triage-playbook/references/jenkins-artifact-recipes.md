# Bounded Jenkins-Style Artifact Recipes

These recipes use the private helper as the canonical transport boundary. The allowed host is fixed by the private release, and job names are examples. Run the installed helper directly; avoid wrapping authenticated calls in a broad shell command.

```bash
helper="$HOME/.codex/skills/bug-triage-playbook/scripts/jenkins_artifact_probe.py"
artifact_dir="$(mktemp -d /tmp/artifact-probe.XXXXXX)"
```

The output parent must already exist, its path chain must not contain non-sticky group/other-writable directories, and each persistent destination must be absent. These checks cover traditional owner/mode/sticky semantics, not extended ACLs; choose a chain with no ACL grant to another principal. The standard sticky root-owned `/tmp` plus a private `mktemp` directory without such ACL grants satisfy this policy. Clean up the task-scoped directory when the task ends.

## Probe Access

Let the helper check whether the fixed auth variables are present. Do not run `printenv`, `env`, or another value-producing command for this preflight; the helper reports the missing variable names without exposing values.

```bash
python3 "$helper" probe-url \
  'https://engci-private-sjc.cisco.com/job/example/42/api/json' \
  --auth-profile wme_jenkins_jobs_artifact \
  --deadline-seconds 20
```

Interpret `auth=absent` and `auth=present` as transport state, not as proof that a credential is valid. HTTP, policy, and deadline errors remain distinct.
Authenticated requests are limited to the fixed HTTPS host on port 443; an explicit non-default port is rejected before credentials are added.

## Show Bounded Text

```bash
python3 "$helper" show-url \
  'https://engci-private-sjc.cisco.com/job/example/42/consoleText' \
  --auth-profile wme_jenkins_jobs_artifact \
  --grep 'ERROR|FAIL|Exception|timeout' \
  --ignore-case \
  --context 2 \
  --line-numbers \
  --max-bytes 8388608 \
  --max-emit-lines 80 \
  --deadline-seconds 30
```

`--grep`, `--head`, and `--tail` are mutually exclusive selection modes. `--head` stops the remote text scan after the requested prefix, while `--tail` and `--grep` must scan the bounded input. All modes are also bounded by the emitted-line and emitted-byte ceilings. A command-line limit can only tighten its compiled hard ceiling.

Text-oriented stdout is budgeted UTF-8 and escapes non-printable characters, so it is safe diagnostic rendering rather than a byte-for-byte copy. Use `fetch-url` or `zip-extract` when exact bytes are required.

## Fetch Without Overwrite

```bash
python3 "$helper" fetch-url \
  'https://engci-private-sjc.cisco.com/job/example/42/artifact/logs.zip' \
  --auth-profile wme_jenkins_jobs_artifact \
  --output "$artifact_dir/logs.zip" \
  --max-bytes 134217728 \
  --deadline-seconds 60
```

The helper checks destination absence before opening the remote response. It publishes a completed same-parent mode-`0600` file atomically and never overwrites an existing path. A reported worker failure or enforced deadline leaves no final partial file; an inconclusive timeout cleanup is reported explicitly. Abrupt parent termination that cannot execute receipt cleanup is outside this guarantee and can leave a private temporary file or a fully published final file.

Authenticated redirects are accepted only on the same effective HTTPS origin. Cross-host, cross-port, downgrade, inline-credential, loop, and excessive-hop redirects are rejected before another request is sent.

## Validate And List A ZIP

```bash
python3 "$helper" zip-list "$artifact_dir/logs.zip" \
  --match 'console|error|fail|\.log$' \
  --ignore-case \
  --limit 80 \
  --deadline-seconds 20
```

Listing validates the bounded central directory before allocating the complete inventory. Hard ceilings cover archive and central-directory bytes, member count, member-name bytes, per-member and aggregate compressed/uncompressed bytes, compression ratio, and selected members. Only stored and bounded-output DEFLATE members are accepted; unsafe paths, portable duplicate names, symlinks, special files, encryption, unsupported feature versions, and other compression methods are rejected with controlled artifact diagnostics.

## Show One Or A Bounded Set Of Members

```bash
python3 "$helper" zip-show "$artifact_dir/logs.zip" \
  'logs/console.txt' \
  --grep 'ERROR|FAIL|Exception|timeout' \
  --ignore-case \
  --context 2 \
  --line-numbers \
  --max-emit-lines 80 \
  --deadline-seconds 20
```

Regex selection is available with `--regex`; multiple matches require `--all` and still obey `--max-selected-members`. Before rendering, each selected member's exact declared compressed span is independently streamed: stored and DEFLATE output must match the declared length and CRC, and DEFLATE must reach its exact end without trailing or unconsumed compressed data. This verification is not shortened by `--head`. `zip-list` validates metadata without decompressing payloads, so a successful list is not a payload-integrity claim.

## Extract One Exact Member

```bash
python3 "$helper" zip-extract "$artifact_dir/logs.zip" \
  'logs/console.txt' \
  --output "$artifact_dir/console.txt" \
  --max-bytes 33554432 \
  --deadline-seconds 20
```

Extraction accepts one exact regular-file member and never uses `extractall`. It verifies the same exact compressed-span, output-length, CRC, and DEFLATE-end properties before publishing. Publication has the same absent-destination, existing-parent, same-parent, mode-`0600`, atomic no-clobber contract as `fetch-url`.

## Finish

Report only the sanitized remote label or exact local path, member, five to ten decisive lines, and any explicit blocker. Remove the task-scoped directory when its artifacts are no longer needed:

Cleanup is destructive. Prefer recoverable cleanup tooling when it is available. Before using direct removal, confirm that the variable still names the exact task-scoped `/tmp/artifact-probe.*` directory and not a broader path:

```bash
rm -rf "$artifact_dir"
```
